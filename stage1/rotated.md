# Rotated!

They went and ROTated the flag by 5 and then ROTated it by 8! The scoundrels! Anyway once they were done this was all that was left VprPGS{jnvg_bar_cyhf_1_vf_3?}

## Solution

The problem clearly hints to a ROT cipher, specifically a ROT5 and then a ROT8. As ROT is additive, running the ciphertext through a ROT13 decryption will yield the flag. 

## Flag

IceCTF{wait_one_plus_1_is_3?}
