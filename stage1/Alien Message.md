# Spotlight

We found this [suspicous image](https://play.icec.tf/problem-static/alien_message_b84f283848b7f34fd4c7529186e66e120b0a374c9d0f2a225b0a7a215716afb5.png) online and it looked like it had been planted there by an alien life form. Can you see if you can figure out what they're trying to tell us? 

## Solution

Here we have a futurama themed symbol substitution cryptogram.
You can search online for the substitution tables and easily do it. I googled Futurama alien cipher and found a table instantly. Also, BIG symbols mean CAPITAL letters, small symbols mean lowercase letters.
