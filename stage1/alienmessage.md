# Alien Message
We found this [suspicous image](https://play.icec.tf/problem-static/alien_message_b84f283848b7f34fd4c7529186e66e120b0a374c9d0f2a225b0a7a215716afb5.png) online and it looked like it had been planted there by an alien life form. Can you see if you can figure out what they're trying to tell us?

## File

![Alien Text](/images/stage1/alienmessage.png)

## Solution

The background of the image is the background for the Futurama title screen, which, after some searching leads to a language called "Alienese". Translating the message to English reveals the key.
